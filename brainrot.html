      <h1><font style="color:red">BRAINROT HISTORY
</h1></font>
</center>
 <br><br>
<h1><mark><font style="color:blue">If you have been on social media recently, you probably have experienced it. “Brain rot” is the term used to describe the mental effects of excessive internet use, especially exposure to low-effort, repetitive, and flashy content. But what is brain rot really, and where did it come from?
</font></h1></mark>
<p>While the real beginnings of brain rot are up to interpretation, the most likely start to the culture was in 2012 with shows like Annoying Orange and the troll face meme. These memes created the idea that Loud = Funny, which is a common trope throughout the modern forms of brain rot. Some say these jokes were just memes and not brain rot, which is understandable. Looking back now, they are just seen as cringeworthy and did not age very well.</p>

       <p>In 2014, there was further development. The creation of MLG videos became highly popular during this time, featuring hyper-edited videos and displaying a continuity of the Loud = Funny trope. Vine also emerged during this time, developing a new sense of humor where being quirky and random was funny. It’s during this time that we see the real building blocks of modern brain rot being laid. </p>

      </font></h1></mark>
<p>2017-2019 was when things really started to ramp up. Kids were gaining access to the internet at younger and younger ages, and the game Fortnite became crazy popular among the younger generation. This created the perfect breeding ground for low-effort, repetitive memes. Kids started copying dances from Fortnite and consuming content about Fortnite on sites like YouTube and Twitch. This is very important because it gives rise to an important aspect of brain rot, which is the effect that content creators have on brain rot culture. Creators like Ninja, Tfue unknowingly created a new language that became extremely popular in brain rot culture</p>

         </font></h1></mark>
<p>2020 was the beginning of the end. To start off the year, Among Us became extremely popular, creating a whole new genre of brain rot. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic. Following this announcement, schools started locking down, and everything went online. This was perfect for brain rot. Everyone being hunkered down in their homes, spending all day on a screen, created the best environment for brain rot to thrive. </p>
    <p>One of the more infamous and influential forms of modern brain rot started when Yasin Cengiz, a Turkish TikToker, became popular for his viral belly-bouncing dance to the song “Dom Dom Yes Yes” by Biser King. This trend ended up popularizing the term skibbity, which then spiraled out of control, leading to the creation of skibbity toilet. </p>
